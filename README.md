 Input 
o The input here is hard code &quot;*&quot;.
 The pattern is printed in this snippet.
o Processing:
 The processing is as follows.

First, we will put j = * and we will increment it in do after
while part will run in which j &lt;= 8 meaning it will print * 8
times and next again while part will run as it is a nested loop
in this we are telling it will print 4 times in a column

 Output
o The pattern is printed in this snippet.
